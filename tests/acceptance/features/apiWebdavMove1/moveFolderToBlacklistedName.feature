Feature: users cannot move (rename) a folder to a blacklisted name
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to prevent users from moving (renaming) folders to specified names
  So that I can prevent unwanted folder names existing in the cloud storage

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @issue-ocis-reva-211
  Scenario Outline: Rename a folder to a name that is banned by default
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/testshare"
    When user "Alice" moves folder "/testshare" to "/.htaccess" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And user "Alice" should see the following elements
      | /testshare/ |
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |


  @skipOnOcV10.3
  Scenario Outline: rename a folder to a folder name that matches (or not) blacklisted_files_regex
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has created folder "/testshare"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    # Note: we have to write JSON for the value, and to get a backslash in the double-quotes we have to escape it
    # The actual regular expressions end up being .*\.ext$ and ^bannedfilename\..+
    And the administrator has updated system config key "blacklisted_files_regex" with value '[".*\\.ext$","^bannedfilename\\..+","containsbannedstring"]' and type "json"
    When user "Brian" moves folder "/testshare" to these foldernames using the webDAV API then the results should be as listed
      | foldername                             | http-code | exists |
      | .ext                                   | 403       | no     |
