Feature: users cannot upload a file to or into an excluded directory
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to exclude directories (folders) from being processed. Any attempt to upload a file to one of those names should be refused.
  So that I can have directories on my cloud server storage that are not available for syncing.

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @skipOnOcV10.3
  @issue-ocis-reva-54
  Scenario Outline: upload a file to a filename that matches (or not) excluded_directories_regex
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    # Note: we have to write JSON for the value, and to get a backslash in the double-quotes we have to escape it
    # The actual regular expressions end up being endswith\.bad$ and ^\.git
    And the administrator has updated system config key "excluded_directories_regex" with value '["endswith\\.bad$","^\\.git","containsvirusinthename"]' and type "json"
    When user "Alice" uploads to these filenames with content "uploaded content" using the webDAV API then the results should be as listed
      | filename                                   | http-code | exists |
      | endswith.bad                               | 403       | no     |
